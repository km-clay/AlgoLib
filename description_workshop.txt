A library that contains useful algorithms and helper functions for gathering information in 2D space.

I ended up using a lot of the same algorithms across all of my mods and thought that re-implementing them every time was annoying, so I made this library.

This mod doesn't do anything on its own, it exists solely to expose useful tools for myself and other modders.

Highlights include:
[list]
	[*] Graph search iterators that traverse grid coordinates:
	[list]
		[*] Breadth-first search for radial searches that expand from a specific point
		[*] Bresenham's Line Algorithm for raycasting
	[/list]
  [*] Utilities for pathfinding:
  [list]
		[*] A* pathfinding algorithm with optional stagnation limits
		[*] Path smoothing/node pruning tools
  [/list]

	[*] A nice way to get tiles safely without having to remember to check WorldGen.InWorld every time
	[*] A dozen different functions for getting information about two points, such as distance, angle, direction, etc
[/list]

The implementation of the point iterator algorithms in particular is quite optimized, and run comfortably in hot loops.

I highly recommend it for cutting down on boilerplate in mods that are heavy on analyzing tiles.
